# Extract
Python programs that extract info about a windows pc (won't work on linux).
The second one that have ip in the name will extract both the ip and the wifis that the pc was connected to but it will require the pc having access to internet.
I made the encoding as an input so that anyone could put the encoding(850 , utf-8 , utf-16...) of his country , but once you know it just make the encoding a variable(string) with the encoding you want.
The info that the program extracts will be saved as a '.txt' file randomly named.
You can make the file '.exe' using pyinstaller.
